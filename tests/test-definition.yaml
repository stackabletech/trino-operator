# These tests can run against an OpenShift cluster, provided you note the following:
#
# 1. Set the "openshift" dimension below to "true" (with quotes)
# 2. Comment out the "true" option in the "s3-use-tls" dimension TODO: Trino requires S3 to use TLS.
#
# Regarding point 2.: the bitnami chart is used for S3 on OpenShift as it correctly installs
# a minio instance (the chart from minio does not correctly apply the service account to
# the job that creates the bucket, and so the permissions are not sufficient). However, it
# cannot correctly use self-signed TLS certificates due to a bug in libminioclient.sh: for
# non-OpenShift clusters the minio chart is thus used instead.
