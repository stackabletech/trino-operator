# The MinIO chart does not work on OpenShift due to it not using the applicable
# ServiceAccount to the bucket creation job. Hence, the Bitnami chart is used.
#
# However, the Bitnami chart for MinIO which cannot use self-signed TLS
# certificates due to a bug in libminioclient.sh.
#
# Therefore, testing S3 access with TLS on OpenShift is currently broken due to
# the Native S3 implementation in Trino requiring S3 connections to use TLS.
#
# libminioclient.sh hard-codes localhost in the certificate:

# This should be revisited in case it now works.
