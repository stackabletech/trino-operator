== Pre-requisites

** a Stackable xref:secret-operator::index.adoc[Secret Operator] for certificates when deploying for TLS
** a Stackable xref:commons-operator::index.adoc[Commons Operator] for certificates when deploying for TLS authentication
** (for authorization): a Stackable xref:opa::index.adoc[OPA Operator][OPA-Operator]
** the https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:packages:trino-cli%2Ftrino-cli-363-executable.jar[Trino CLI] to test SQL queries
