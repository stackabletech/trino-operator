= Black Hole

Primarily the https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/blackhole.html[Black Hole connector] is designed for high performance testing of other components.
It works like the `/dev/null` device on Unix-like operating systems for data writing and like `/dev/null` or `/dev/zero` for data reading.

== Example Black Hole catalog configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  # The name of the catalog as it will appear in Trino
  name: blackhole
  # TrinoCluster can use these labels to select which catalogs to include
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    blackhole: {} # No options needed
----

[NOTE]
====
This connector does not work properly with multiple coordinators, since each coordinator has different metadata.
