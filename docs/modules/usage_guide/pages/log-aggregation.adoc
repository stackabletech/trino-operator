= Log aggregation

The logs can be forwarded to a Vector log aggregator by providing a discovery
ConfigMap for the aggregator and by enabling the log agent:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
  coordinators:
    config:
      logging:
        enableVectorAgent: true
----
