= Log aggregation

The logs can be forwarded to a Vector log aggregator by providing a discovery
ConfigMap for the aggregator and by enabling the log agent:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    vectorAggregatorConfigMapName: vector-aggregator-discovery
  coordinators:
    config:
      logging:
        enableVectorAgent: true
        containers:
          trino:
            loggers:
              io.trino:
                level: INFO
----

Currently, the logs are collected only for `server.log`. Logging for `http-request.log` is disabled by default.
