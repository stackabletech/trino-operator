= Configuration

The cluster definition also supports overriding configuration properties and environment variables, either per role or per role group, where the more specific override (role group) has precedence over the less specific one (role).

IMPORTANT: Do not override port numbers. This will lead to faulty installations.

== Configuration Properties

For a role or role group, at the same level of `config`, you can specify: `configOverrides` for:

- `config.properties`
- `node.properties`
- `log.properties`
- `password-authenticator.properties`

For a list of possible configuration properties consult the https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/properties.html[Trino Properties Reference].

[source,yaml]
----
workers:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      replicas: 1
      configOverrides:
        config.properties:
          query.max-memory-per-node: "2GB"
----

Just as for the `config`, it is possible to specify this at role level as well:

[source,yaml]
----
workers:
  configOverrides:
    config.properties:
      query.max-memory-per-node: "2GB"
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      replicas: 1
----

All override property values must be strings. The properties will be passed on without any escaping or formatting.

== Environment Variables

Environment variables can be (over)written by adding the `envOverrides` property.

For example per role group:

[source,yaml]
----
workers:
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      replicas: 1
      envOverrides:
        JAVA_HOME: "path/to/java"
----

or per role:

[source,yaml]
----
workers:
  envOverrides:
    JAVA_HOME: "path/to/java"
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config: {}
      replicas: 1
----

Here too, overriding properties such as `http-server.https.port` will lead to broken installations.

== Resources

=== Storage for data volumes

You can mount a volume where data (config and logs of Trino) is stored by specifying https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes[PersistentVolumeClaims] for each individual role or role group:

[source,yaml]
----
workers:
  config:
    resources:
      storage:
        data:
          capacity: 2Gi
  roleGroups:
    default:
      config:
        resources:
          storage:
            data:
              capacity: 3Gi
----

In the above example, all Trino workers in the default group will store data (the location of the property `--data-dir`) on a `3Gi` volume. Additional role groups not specifying any resources will inherit the config provided on the role level (`2Gi` volume). This works the same for memory or CPU requests.

By default, in case nothing is configured in the custom resource for a certain role group, each Pod will have a `2Gi` large local volume mount for the data location containing mainly logs.

=== Resource Requests

include::home:concepts:stackable_resource_requests.adoc[]

A minimal HA setup consisting of 1 coordinator and 2 worker instances has the following https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/manage-resources-containers/[resource requirements]:

* `3350m` CPU request
* `11700m` CPU limit
* `12704m` memory request and limit
* `3072Mi` persistent storage

Corresponding to the values above, the operator uses the following resource defaults:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  coordinators:
    config:
      resources:
        cpu:
          min: '500m'
          max: '2000m'
        memory:
          limit: '4Gi'
        storage:
          data:
            capacity: '1Gi'
  workers:
    config:
      resources:
        cpu:
          min: '1000m'
          max: '4000m'
        memory:
          limit: '4Gi'
        storage:
          data:
            capacity: '1Gi'
----

WARNING: The default values are _most likely_ not sufficient to run a proper cluster in production. Please adapt according to your requirements.
