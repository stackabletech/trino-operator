= Generic

Trino supports lots of different connectors and we cannot cover all the available connectors.
In case the trino-operator does not support a specific connector you can use this connector to pull in https://trino.io/docs/current/connector.html[any connector Trino supports}.

This is how you can e.g. use the https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/postgresql.html[PostgreSQL connector]:

== Add contents from Secrets or ConfigMaps

In some cases you don't want to add sensitive data (such as PostgreSQL credentials) to a `TrinoCatalog`.
You can then use `valueFromSecret` or `valueFromSecret` to pull in properties securely.
An entry must be an valid `SecretKeySelector` or `ConfigMapKeySelector`.

== Add additional contents

In case you need more contents, such as the need to mount Secrets - containing e.g. certificates or keytabs - please consult the xref:nightly@home:concepts:overrides.adoc#_pod_overrides[documentation on podOverrides].
