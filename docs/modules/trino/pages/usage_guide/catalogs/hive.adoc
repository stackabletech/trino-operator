= Apache Hive

The Apache Hive connector allows Trino to connect to a Hive metastore and query data stored in Apache Hadoop or S3 compatible objects storage.


== Example Hive catalog configuration
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  # The name of the catalog as it will appear in Trino
  name: hive-catalog
  # TrinoCluster can use these labels to select which catalogs to include
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    # Specify hive here when defining a hive catalog
    hive:
      metastore:
        configMap: simple-hive
      s3:
        inline:
          host: test-minio
          port: 9000
          accessStyle: Path
          credentials:
            secretClass: minio-credentials
# We can use configOverrides to add arbitrary properties to the Trino catalog configuration
  configOverrides:
    hive.metastore.username: trino
----

== Connect to S3 store
The hive connector can connect to an S3 store as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  connector:
    hive:
      s3:
        inline:
          host: test-minio
          port: 9000
          accessStyle: Path
          credentials:
            secretClass: minio-credentials
      # OR
      s3:
        reference: my-minio
----

See xref:concepts:s3.adoc[] for details about S3 connections.

IMPORTANT: Please make sure that the underlying Hive metastore also has access to the S3 store, because it will e.g. check if the directory exists when creating tables.

== Connect to HDFS cluster
The hive connector can connect to an HDFS operated by Stackable as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  connector:
    hive:
      hdfs:
        configMap: simple-hdfs
----

IMPORTANT: Please make sure that the underlying Hive metastore also has access to the HDFS, because it will e.g. check if the directory exists when creating tables.

== Adding unmanaged Hive clusters
You can add connect Trino to Hive catalogs from systems that are not managed by Stackable, including Hive running on existing Hadoop clusters. Unmanaged Hive instances can be defined by creating a configMap containing the configuration for the remote Hive Metastore and HDFS or S3 storage services.

=== Create a Hive Metastore configMap
The Hive metastore configMap contains the URL for the metastore's thrift endpoint.
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cloudera-hive
data:
  HIVE: thrift://10.132.0.59:9083
----

=== Create a HDFS configMap
When the Hive data is stored on HDFS you will need to provide a configMap containing the HDFS configuration.
To do this take the `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml` from your Hadoop cluster and create a configMap with the keys `core-site.xml` and `hdfs-site.xml`.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: v1
kind: ConfigMap
metadata:
  name: cloudera-hdfs
data:
  core-site.xml: |-
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
        <value>hdfs://my.hadoop.cluster:8020</value>
      </property>
    <!-- truncated for brevity -->
    </configuration>
  hdfs-site.xml: |-
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <configuration>
      <property>
        <name>dfs.namenode.servicerpc-address</name>
        <value>my.hadoop.cluster:8022</value>
      </property>
    <!-- truncated for brevity -->
    </configuration>
----

=== Create the Trino Hive catalog
To use the unmanaged Hive metastore we define a `TrinoCatalog` object in the same way we would for a managed cluster, referencing the custom configMap we created for Hive and HDFS.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  name: clouderahive
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    hive:
      metastore:
        configMap: cloudera-hive
      hdfs:
        configMap: cloudera-hdfs
