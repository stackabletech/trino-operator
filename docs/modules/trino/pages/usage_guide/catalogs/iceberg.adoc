= Apache Iceberg

Apache Iceberg is a format for huge analytic tables designed to address some of the scaling issues with traditional Hive tables. Iceberg depends on Hive metastore being present and makes use of the same metastore configMap used by the Hive connector.

== Example Iceberg catalog configuration

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  # The name of the catalog as it will appear in Trino
  name: iceberg
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    # Specify iceberg here when defining a iceberg catalog
    iceberg:
      metastore:
        configMap: simple-hive-derby
      s3:
        inline:
          host: test-minio
          port: 9000
          accessStyle: Path
          credentials:
            secretClass: minio-credentials

== Connect to S3 store or HDFS
The `iceberg` connector can connect to S3 or HDFS in the same way the xref:usage_guide/catalogs/hive.adoc[] connector does.
Please check that documentation on how to configure the access.
