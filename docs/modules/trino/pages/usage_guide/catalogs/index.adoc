= Catalogs

Trino does not have a built-in catalog and instead `provides` connectors to external data sources. This allows Trino to connect to, read from and join a wide variety of data sources.

== Using catalogs
Catalogues are defined in their own resources and referenced from cluster objects. See the xref:concepts.adoc[] page for more details.

=== Create a catalog

You can create a catalog using the `TrinoCatalog` object as follows.

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  name: hive-catalog
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    hive:
      metastore:
        configMap: simple-hive-derby
      s3:
        inline:
          host: test-minio
          port: 9000
          accessStyle: Path
          credentials:
            secretClass: minio-credentials
# We can use configOverrides to add arbitrary properties to the Trino catalog configuration
  configOverrides:
    hive.metastore.username: trino
---
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  name: iceberg
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    iceberg:
      metastore:
        configMap: simple-hive-derby
      s3:
        inline:
          host: test-minio
          port: 9000
          accessStyle: Path
          credentials:
            secretClass: minio-credentials
----

The `metadata.name` will be the name of the catalog that shows up in your Trino instance.
The `metadata.labels` will be used by `TrinoCluster` to determine the link between Trino clusters and `TrinoCatalogs`.
The `spec.connector.<connector>` determines which connector is used.
Each connector supports a different set of attributes.

=== Add a catalog to a Trino cluster

It is necessary to specify within the `TrinoCluster` which catalogs it should use. Here is an example of this:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCluster
metadata:
  name: simple-trino
spec:
  image:
    productVersion: "396"
    stackableVersion: "23.4.0-rc1"
  catalogLabelSelector:
    matchLabels:
      trino: simple-trino
# ...
----

The `spec.catalogLabelSelector` is used to fetch the list of `TrinoCatalogs` used for this Trino cluster.
In this case the `hive` and `iceberg` catalogs will be used as they both match the `catalogLabelSelector` value `simple-trino`.

A `TrinoCluster` can, once created, detect and use new catalogs that have been subsequently created with a matching label. This also means that it is possible to reuse a `TrinoCatalog` within multiple `TrinoClusters`.
