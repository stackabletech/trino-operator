= Connect to Trino

Trino offers an SQL endpoint via a HTTP API.
An https://trino.io/docs/current/client/jdbc.html[open source JDBC driver] does exist as well as a proprietary https://docs.starburst.io/data-consumer/clients/odbc.html[ODBC driver].

Multiple SQL clients can be used to connect to Trino as described below.

== Perquisites
The Trino server must be reachable from your local computer.
It is typically secured via HTTPS with a certificated provided by a xref:secret-operator:secretclass.adoc[SecretClass].

As most setups use a self-signed certificate, the easiest way is to disable the Trino cert validation as the following guide will do.
A production-ready solution would be to extract the `ca.crt` from the SecretClass and provide it to the Trino client.

== Connect with trino-cli
Please have a look at the https://trino.io/docs/current/client/cli.html[official trino-cli docs].
Please don't forget to specify the `--insecure` flag, so you command looks something like:

[source,console]
----
java -jar ~/Downloads/trino-cli-403-executable.jar --server https://85.215.195.29:8443 --user admin --password --insecure
----

== Connect with DBeaver
https://dbeaver.io[DBeaver] is a free multi-platform database tool for anyone who needs to work with databases.
It is installed locally and can connect to Trino and offers a convenient UI to explore and work with Trino.

First of you need to click on the `New Database Connection` icon, select `Other` -> `Trino`

Afterwards you need to enter the `Host` as well as the `Port` as well as `Username` and `Password`.

After entering the details you need to switch to the tab called `Driver properties`.
First action is to click on the `SSL` driver property and enter the value `true`.
Additionally you need to click on the green plus icon in the bottom left corner to add a User Property called `SSLVerification`.
Afterwards you need to set the value to `NONE`.

As the last step you can click on `Finish` and start using the Trino connection normally.

== Connect with Python

Please have a look at the https://github.com/trinodb/trino-python-client[official trino-python-client docs].

A sample code could look like follows:

[source,python]
----
def get_connection():
    connection = trino.dbapi.connect(
        host="trino-coordinator-default.default.svc.cluster.local",
        http_scheme="https",
        verify=False, # For best security you can also provide a path to the trino root ca: "/stackable/secrets/trino-ca-cert/ca.crt",
        port=8443,
        user="admin",
        auth=trino.auth.BasicAuthentication("admin", "adminadmin"),
        catalog="hive",
        schema="staging",
    )
    return connection

def run_query(connection, query):
    # print(f"[DEBUG] Executing query {query}")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()

connection = get_connection()

run_query(connection, "show catalogs")
