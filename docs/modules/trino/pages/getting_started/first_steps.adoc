= First steps

After going through the xref:getting_started/installation.adoc[] section and having installed all the operators, you will now deploy a Trino cluster and the required dependencies. Afterwards you can <<_verify_that_it_works, verify that it works>> by running some queries against Trino or visit the Trino web interface.

== Setup Trino

A working Trino cluster and its web interface require only the commons and secret operators to work. Simple tests are possible without an external data source (e.g. PostgreSQL, Hive or S3), as internal data can be used.

Create a file named `trino.yaml` with the following content:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/trino.yaml[]
----

and apply it:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=install-trino]
----

Wait for the Trino cluster to get ready:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=watch-trino-rollout]
----

== Verify that it works

At first, make sure the StatefulSets are ready:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl get statefulset
----

The output should show all pods in the StatefulSets ready:

[source]
----
NAME                                 READY   AGE
simple-trino-coordinator-default     1/1     5m
simple-trino-worker-default          1/1     5m
----

Create a port-forward for the coordinator to access Trino easily in the next steps:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=port-forwarding]
----

=== Access the Trino cluster via CLI tool

We use the https://trino.io/download.html[Trino CLI tool] to access the Trino cluster. This link points to the latest Trino version. In this guide we keep Trino cluster and client versions in sync and download the CLI tool from the https://repo.stackable.tech/[Stackable repository]:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=download-trino-cli]
----

We need to make the CLI tool executable:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=chmod-trino-cli]
----

Now, run some queries against the coordinator. Show available catalogs:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=retrieve-trino-catalogs]
----

which should output:

[source]
----
system
----

Check how many workers are connected to the coordinator:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=retrieve-trino-workers]
----

which should output:

[source]
----
1
----

Congratulations, you set up your first Stackable Trino cluster successfully.

=== Access the Trino web interface

With the port-forward still active, you can connect to the Trino web interface. Enter `https://localhost:8443/ui` in your browser and login with the username `admin`. Since no authentication is enabled you do not need to enter a password.

WARNING: Your browser will probably show a security risk warning because it does not trust the self generated TLS certificates. Just ignore that and continue.

After logging in you should see the Trino web interface:

image::trino-web-ui.png[]

If you mark the `Finished` button in the `Query Details` section, you should see the two queries that were sent earlier via the CLI tool:

image::trino-web-ui-finished.png[]

== Clean up

In order to remove the previously downloaded CLI tool, you can safely remove it from your system:

[source]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=cleanup-trino-cli]
----

== What's next

Have a look at the xref:usage_guide/cluster.adoc[] to find out more about how to configure a Trino cluster.
