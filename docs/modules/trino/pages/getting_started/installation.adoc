= Installation

On this page you will install the Stackable Operator for Trino as well as the commons, secret and listener operator which are
required by all Stackable Operators.

== Stackable Operators

There are two ways to install Stackable Operators:

. Using xref:management:stackablectl:index.adoc[stackablectl]
. Using Helm

=== stackablectl

The `stackablectl` command line tool is the recommended way to interact with operators and dependencies. Follow the
xref:management:stackablectl:installation.adoc[installation steps] for your platform if you choose to work with
`stackablectl`.

After you have installed `stackablectl`, run the following command to install all operators necessary for Trino:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=stackablectl-install-operators]
----

The tool will show

[source]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/install-operator-output.txt[tag=stackablectl-install-operators-output]
----

TIP: Consult the xref:management:stackablectl:quickstart.adoc[] to learn more about how to use `stackablectl`.

=== Helm

You can also use Helm to install the operators. Add the Stackable Helm repository:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=helm-add-repo]
----

Then install the Stackable Operators:

[source,bash]
----
include::example$getting_started/code/getting_started.sh[tag=helm-install-operators]
----

Helm will deploy the operators in a Kubernetes Deployment and apply the CRDs for the Trino service (as well as the CRDs
for the required operators). You are now ready to deploy Trino in Kubernetes.

== Optional installation steps

Some Trino connectors like `hive` or `iceberg` work together with the Apache Hive metastore and S3 buckets. For these
components extra steps are required.

* a Stackable Hive metastore
* an accessible S3 bucket
** an end-point, and access- and secret-keys
** data in the bucket (we use the https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/iris[Iris] dataset here)
* the following are optional
** a Stackable xref:secret-operator:index.adoc[Secret Operator] for certificates when deploying for TLS
** a Stackable xref:commons-operator:index.adoc[Commons Operator] for certificates when deploying for TLS authentication
** (for authorization): a Stackable xref:opa:index.adoc[OPA Operator][OPA-Operator]
** the https://repo.stackable.tech/#browse/browse:packages:trino-cli%2Ftrino-cli-363-executable.jar[Trino CLI] to test
   SQL queries

=== S3 bucket

Please refer to the S3 provider.

=== Hive operator

Please refer to the xref:hive:index.adoc[Hive Operator] docs. Both Hive and Trino need the same S3 authentication.

=== OPA operator

Please refer to the xref:opa:index.adoc[OPA Operator] docs.
