= Service exposition with ListenerClasses

Trino offers a web UI and an API, both are exposed by the `connector` xref:concepts:roles-and-role-groups.adoc[role]. The Operator deploys a service called `<name>-connector` (where `<name>` is the name of the TrinoCluster) through which Trino can be reached.

This service can have three different types: `cluster-internal`, `external-unstable` and `external-stable`. Read more about the types in the xref:concepts:service-exposition.adoc[service exposition] documentation at platform level.

This is how the ListenerClass is configured:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    listenerClass: cluster-internal  # <1>
----
<1> The default `cluster-internal` setting.
