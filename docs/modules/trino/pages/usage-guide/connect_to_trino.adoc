Trino offers an SQL endpoint via a HTTP API.
An {trino-jdbc}[open source JDBC driver] does exist as well as a proprietary {starburst-odbc}[ODBC driver].

Multiple SQL clients can be used to connect to Trino as described below.

== Prerequisites
The Trino server must be reachable from your local computer.
It is typically secured via HTTPS with a certificated provided by a xref:secret-operator:secretclass.adoc[SecretClass].

As most setups use a self-signed certificate, that cannot be verified without the CA certificate, the easiest way is to disable the Trino cert validation as the following guide will do, however this is not secure!
To use certificate validation instead, you need to extract the `ca.crt` file from the the SecretClass and provide it to the Trino client.

== Connect with trino-cli
Please have a look at the {trino-cli}[official trino-cli docs].
Please don't forget to specify the `--insecure` flag, so your command looks something like:

[source,console]
----
$ java -jar ~/Downloads/trino-cli-403-executable.jar --server https://85.215.195.29:8443 --user admin --password --insecure
----

== Connect with DBeaver
{dbeaver}[DBeaver] is a free multi-platform database tool for anyone who needs to work with databases.
It is installed locally and can connect to Trino and offers a convenient UI to explore and work with Trino.

First of you need to click on the _New Database Connection_ icon, select _Other_ > _Trino_.

Afterwards you need to enter the _Host_ and _Port_ as well as _Username_ and _Password_.

After entering the details you need to switch to the tab called _Driver properties_.
First action is to click on the `SSL` driver property and enter the value `true`.
Additionally you need to click on the green plus icon in the bottom left corner to add a _User Property_ called `SSLVerification`.
Afterwards you need to set the value to `NONE`.

As the last step you can click on _Finish_ and start using the Trino connection.

== Connect with Python

Please have a look at the official {trino-python-client}[trino-python-client].

A minimal example of making a connection and running a query looks like this:

[source,python]
----
def get_connection():
    connection = trino.dbapi.connect(
        host="trino-coordinator-default.default.svc.cluster.local",
        http_scheme="https",
        verify=False, # For best security you can also provide a path to the trino root ca: "/stackable/secrets/trino-ca-cert/ca.crt",
        port=8443,
        user="admin",
        auth=trino.auth.BasicAuthentication("admin", "adminadmin"),
        catalog="hive",
        schema="staging",
    )
    return connection

def run_query(connection, query):
    # print(f"[DEBUG] Executing query {query}")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    cursor.execute(query)
    return cursor.fetchall()

connection = get_connection()

run_query(connection, "show catalogs")
----
