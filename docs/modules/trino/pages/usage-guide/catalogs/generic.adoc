= Generic

Trino supports lots of different connectors and we cannot cover all the available connectors.
In case the trino-operator does not support a specific connector you can use this connector to pull in https://trino.io/docs/current/connector.html[any connector Trino supports}.

This is how you can e.g. use the https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/postgresql.html[PostgreSQL connector]:

== Example generic catalog properties
[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  # The name of the catalog as it will appear in Trino
  name: postgres
  # TrinoCluster can use these labels to select which catalogs to include
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    generic:
      connectorName: postgresql
      properties: # optional
        connection-url:
          value: jdbc:postgresql://example.net:5432/database
        connection-user:
          valueFromSecret:
            name: my-postgresql-credentials-secret
            key: user
        connection-password:
          valueFromSecret:
            name: my-postgresql-credentials-secret
            key: password
#         extra-property-from-configmap:
#           valueFromConfigMap:
#             name: my-configmap
#             key: my-key
---
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: my-postgresql-credentials-secret
stringData:
  user: root
  password: rootroot

== Add contents from Secrets or ConfigMaps

In some cases you don't want to add sensitive data (such as PostgreSQL credentials) to a `TrinoCatalog`.
You can then use `valueFromSecret` or `valueFromSecret` to pull in properties securely.
An entry must be an valid `SecretKeySelector` or `ConfigMapKeySelector`.

== Add additional contents

In case you need more contents, such as the need to mount Secrets - containing e.g. certificates or keytabs - please consult the xref:nightly@home:concepts:overrides.adoc#_pod_overrides[documentation on podOverrides].

== Troubleshoot

=== Capitalized or upper case table names with PostgreSQL / MySQL

If table names are capitalized or upper case in PostgreSQL / MySQL, Trino can list the tables contained in a schema (lower case) but cannot access any data due to the error:

`Table '<catalog>.<schema>.<table>' does not exist io.trino.spi.TrinoException: line 2:6: Table '<catalog>.<schema>.<table>' does not exist`

This is fixed by setting the `case-insensitive-name-matching` connector property which works for both https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/postgresql.html#general-configuration-properties[PostgreSQL connector] and https://trino.io/docs/current/connector/mysql.html#general-configuration-properties[MySQL Connector].

This can be added to the generic connector as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  connector:
    generic:
      ...
      properties:
        case-insensitive-name-matching:
          value: "true"
      ...
----
