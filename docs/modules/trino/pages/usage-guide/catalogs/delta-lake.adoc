= Delta Lake

[Delta Lake](https://delta.io/) is an open-source storage framework that enables building a Lakehouse architecture with support for multiple compute engines.
It depends on a Hive metastore being present and makes use of the same metastore ConfigMap used by the Hive connector.

== Example Delta Lake catalog configuration

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  # The name of the catalog as it will appear in Trino
  name: delta
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    # Specify deltaLake here when defining a Delta Lake catalog
    deltaLake:
      metastore:
        configMap: simple-hive
      s3:
        inline:
          host: test-minio
          port: 9000
          accessStyle: Path
          credentials:
            secretClass: minio-credentials

== Connect to S3 store or HDFS
The Delta Lake connector can connect to S3 or HDFS in the same way the xref:usage-guide/catalogs/hive.adoc[] connector does.
Please check that documentation on how to configure the access.
