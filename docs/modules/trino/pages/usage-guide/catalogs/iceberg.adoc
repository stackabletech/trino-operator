= Apache Iceberg

Apache Iceberg is a format for huge analytic tables designed to address some of the scaling issues with traditional Hive tables.
Iceberg depends on a Hive metastore being present and makes use of the same metastore ConfigMap used by the Hive connector.

You can deploy a Hive Metastore Stacklet with the xref:hive:index.adoc[].

== Example Iceberg catalog configuration

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCatalog
metadata:
  name: iceberg  # <1>
  labels:
    trino: simple-trino
spec:
  connector:
    # Specify iceberg here when defining a iceberg catalog
    iceberg:
      metastore:
        configMap: simple-hive  # <2>
      s3:
        inline:
          host: test-minio
          port: 9000
          accessStyle: Path
          credentials:
            secretClass: minio-credentials
----
<1> The name of the catalog as it will appear in Trino
<2> This is the name of your Hive Stacklet

== Connect to S3 store or HDFS
The Iceberg connector can connect to S3 or HDFS in the same way the xref:usage-guide/catalogs/hive.adoc[] connector does.
Please check that documentation on how to configure the access.
