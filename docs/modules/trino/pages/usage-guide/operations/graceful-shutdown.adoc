= Graceful shutdown

You can configure the graceful shutdown as described in xref:concepts:operations/graceful_shutdown.adoc[].

== Coordinators

As a default, coordinators have `15 minutes` to terminate gracefully.

The coordinator process will receive a `SIGTERM` signal when Kubernetes wants to terminate the Pod.
After the graceful shutdown timeout runs out, and the process still didn't exit, Kubernetes will issue a `SIGKILL` signal.

When a coordinator gets restarted, all currently running queries will fail and cannot be recovered after the restart process is finished.
As of Trino version `428` this can not be prevented (e.g. by using multiple coordinators).

== Workers

As a default, Coordinators have `60 minutes` to terminate gracefully.

Trino supports https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/graceful-shutdown.html[gracefully shutting down] workers.
This operator always adds a https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/container-lifecycle-hooks/[`PreStop` hook] to gracefully shut them down.
No additional configuration is needed, this guide is intended for users that need to tweak this mechanism.

The default graceful shutdown period is `1` hour, but it can be configured as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
apiVersion: trino.stackable.tech/v1alpha1
kind: TrinoCluster
metadata:
  name: trino
spec:
  # ...
  workers:
    config:
      gracefulShutdownTimeout: 1h
    roleGroups:
      default:
        replicas: 1
----

== Implementation

Once a worker Pod is asked to terminate, the `PreStop` hook is executed and the following timeline occurs:

1. The worker goes into `SHUTTING_DOWN` state.
2. The worker sleeps for `30` seconds to ensure that the coordinator has noticed the shutdown and stops scheduling new tasks on the worker.
3. The worker now waits till all tasks running on it complete. This will take as long as the longest running query takes.
4. The worker sleeps for `30` seconds to ensure that the coordinator has
noticed that all tasks are complete
5. The `PreStop` hook will never return, but the JVM will be shut down by the graceful shutdown mechanism.
6. If the graceful shutdown doesn't complete quick enough (e.g. a query runs longer than the graceful shutdown period), after `<graceful shutdown period> + 30s of step 2 + 30s of step 4 + 10s safety overhead` the Pod gets killed, regardless if it has shut down gracefully or not. This is achieved by setting `terminationGracePeriodSeconds` on the worker Pods. Currently running queries on the worker will fail and cannot be recovered.

[WARNING]
====
As of SDP version `23.7`, the secret-operator issues TLS certificates with a lifetime of 24h.
It also adds an annotation to the Pod, indicating it requires a restart 30 minutes before the certificate expires (23.5h hours in this case).
Currently, this results in all Pod using HTTPS (both coordinator and workers in a typical setup) to be restarted every 23.5 hours.

The TLS certificate lifetime can be configured using `podOverrides` by setting `secrets.stackable.tech/backend.autotls.cert.lifetime` on every secret-operator volume.
One sample configuration could look like:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  workers:
    podOverrides:
      spec:
        volumes:
          - name: server-tls-mount
            ephemeral:
              volumeClaimTemplate:
                metadata:
                  annotations:
                    secrets.stackable.tech/backend.autotls.cert.lifetime: 14d
          - name: internal-tls-mount
            ephemeral:
              volumeClaimTemplate:
                metadata:
                  annotations:
                    secrets.stackable.tech/backend.autotls.cert.lifetime: 14d

== Implications

All queries that take less than the minimal graceful shutdown period of all roleGroups (`1` hour as a default) are guaranteed to not be disturbed by regular termination of Pods.
They can obviously still fail when, for example, a Kubernetes node dies or gets rebooted before it is fully drained.

Because of this, the operator automatically restricts the execution time of queries to the minimal graceful shutdown period of all roleGroups using the Trino configuration `query.max-execution-time=3600s`.
This causes all queries that take longer than 1 hour to fail with the error message `Query failed: Query exceeded the maximum execution time limit of 3600s.00s`.

In case you need to execute queries that take longer than the configured graceful shutdown period, you need to increase the `query.max-execution-time` property as follows:

[source,yaml]
----
spec:
  coordinators:
    configOverrides:
      config.properties:
        query.max-execution-time: 24h
----

Please keep in mind, that queries taking longer than the graceful shutdown period are now subject to failure when a Trino worker gets shut down.
Running into this issue can be circumvented by using https://trino.io/docs/current/admin/fault-tolerant-execution.html[Fault-tolerant execution], which is not supported natively yet.
Until native support is added, you will have to use `configOverrides` to enable it.

== Authorization requirements

WARNING: When you are not using OPA for authorization, the user `admin` is not allowed to gracefully shut down workers.
If you need graceful shutdown you need to use OPA or need to make sure `admin` is allowed to gracefully shut down workers (e.g. having you own authorizer or patching Trino).

In case you use OPA to authorize Trino requests, you need to make sure the user `admin` is authorized to trigger a graceful shutdown of the workers.
You can achieve this e.g. by adding the following rule, which grants `admin` the permissions to do anything - including graceful shutdown.

[source,rego]
----
allow {
  input.context.identity.user == "admin"
}
----

In case the user `admin` does not have the permission to gracefully shut down a worker, the error message `curl: (22) The requested URL returned error: 403 Forbidden` will be shown in the worker log and the worker will shut down immediately.

NOTE: We plan to add CustomResources, so that you can define your Trino ACLs via Kubernetes objects. In this case the trino-operator will generate the rego-rules for you, and will add the needed rules for graceful shutdown for you. Until then, you need to grant the permission yourself.
