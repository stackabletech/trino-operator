= Allowed Pod disruptions

You can configure the permitted Pod disruptions for Trino nodes as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].

Unless you configure something else or disable the provided PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs), the following PDBs are written:

== Coordinators
The provided PDBs only allow a single coordinator to be offline at any given time, regardless of the number of replicas or `roleGroups`.

== Workers
Normally users deploy multiple workers to speed up queries, handle multiple queries in parallel or to just have enough memory available in the Cluster to execute a big query.

Taking this into consideration, the operator uses the following algorithm to determine the maximum number of workers allowed to be unavailable at the same time:

`num_workers` is the number of workers in the Trino cluster, summed over all `roleGroups`.

[source,rust]
----
// As users normally scale Trino workers to achieve more performance, we can safely take out 10% of the workers.
let max_unavailable = num_workers / 10;

// Clamp to at least a single node allowed to be offline, so we don't block Kubernetes nodes from draining.
let max_unavailable = max(max_unavailable, 1)
----

This results e.g. in the following numbers:

[cols="1,1"]
|===
|Number of workers
|Maximum unavailable workers

|1 - 9
|1

|10 - 19
|1

|20 - 29
|2

|30 - 39
|3

|100 - 109
|10
|===

== Reduce rolling redeployment durations
The default PDBs of the operator are pessimistic and will cause the rolling redeployment to take a considerable amount of time.
As an example, in a cluster with 100 workers, 10 workers are restarted at the same time. Assuming a worker takes 5 minutes to properly restart, the whole redeployment will take (100 nodes / 10 nodes simultaneous * 5 minutest = ) 50 minutes.

You can use the following measures to speed this up:

1. Increase `maxUnavailable` using the `spec.workers.roleConfig.podDisruptionBudget.maxUnavailable` field as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc[].
2. Write your own PDBs as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_disruptions.adoc#_using_you_own_custom_pdbs[Using you own custom PDBs].

WARNING: In case you modify or disable the default PDBs, it is your responsibility to make sure there are enough workers available to manage the existing workload and performance requirements!
