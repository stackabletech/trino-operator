= Pod placement

You can configure the Pod placement of the Trino pods as described in xref:concepts:operations/pod_placement.adoc[].

The default affinities created by the operator are:

1. Co-locate all the Trino Pods (weight 20)
2. Distribute all Pods within the same role (coordinators, workers) (weight 70)

Additionally the operator will look through every `TrinoCatalog` you configure and will set up the following affinities:

1. Hive + Iceberg connector: Co-locate the coordinators with the hive metastores (weight 50)
2. Hive + Iceberg connector: Co-locate the workers with the hdfs datanodes (if hdfs is used) (weight 50)
