:description: The managed Trino instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics.

The managed Trino instances are automatically configured to export Prometheus metrics.
See xref:operators:monitoring.adoc[] for more details.

== Metrics

Trino automatically exposes built-in Prometheus metrics on coordinators and workers. The metrics are available on the `http` (`8080/metrics`) or
`https` (`8443/metrics`) port, depending on the TLS settings.

The following `ServiceMonitor` example, demonstrates how the metrics could be scraped using the https://prometheus-operator.dev/[Prometheus Operator].
