This page covers <<Authentication>> and <<Authorization>>.

== [[authentication]]Authentication

Trino supports several https://trino.io/docs/current/security/authentication-types.html[authentication types].

Different authentication types can be used simultaneously.

=== Password

The Trino operator currently supports the following `PASSWORD` authenticators.

==== File

The https://trino.io/docs/current/security/password-file.html[file based authentication] can be defined as follows. First create a secret with your users:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-file-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=secret]
----

This contains username and password pairs as shown in the previous snippet. The username and password combinations are provided in the `stringData` field.

The Secret is referenced in an `AuthenticationClass`.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-file-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=authentication_class]
----

Then reference the `AuthenticationClass` in your TrinoCluster definition:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-file-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=trino]
----

Multiple authentication classes with different user secrets can be provided.

The operator never reads secrets directly, but mounts them directly into the `Pod`. Volume mount names can not exceed *63* characters due to Kubernetes restrictions.

For uniqueness, the volume mount name is internally build up of the name of the `AuthenticationClass`. This means the `AuthenticationClass` name must not exceed *63* characters.

IMPORTANT: Due to Kubernetes restrictions, the name of the AuthenticationClass must not exceed *63* characters.

Changes to the referenced user `Secret` (e.g. adding or removing a user) are updated in Trino without restarts but after a small delay. This heavily depends on Kubernetes and may take a couple of minutes.

Adding or removing an `AuthenticationClass` will however result in a `Pod` restart.

==== LDAP

The Trino operator supports https://trino.io/docs/current/security/ldap.html[LDAP authentication] as well and authentication in Stackable is done using xref:home:concepts:authentication.adoc#authenticationclass[AuthenticationClasses]:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-ldap-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=authentication_class]
----

NOTE: You can follow the xref:home:tutorials:authentication_with_openldap.adoc[] tutorial to learn how to create an AuthenticationClass for an LDAP server.

With an AuthenticationClass ready, `PASSWORD` authentication using LDAP is done by referencing the LDAP AuthenticationClass:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-ldap-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=trino]
----

In the Trino CLI and web interface, LDAP users can now be used to log in.

=== OAUTH2

For using https://trino.io/docs/current/security/oauth2.html[OAuth 2.0 authentication], TLS must be enabled and a Secret with the client credentials must be created:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-oidc-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=secret]
----

In the xref:home:concepts:authentication.adoc#authenticationclass[AuthenticationClass], an OpenID Connect (OIDC) provider can be specified:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-oidc-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=authentication_class]
----

NOTE: There is no generic support for OAuth 2, only OpenID Connect providers are supported.

The AuthenticationClass and the Secret with the client credentials must be referenced in the `authentication` section of the Trino cluster:

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-oidc-auth-snippet.yaml[tag=trino]
----

== [[authorization]]Authorization

In order to authorize Trino via OPA, a ConfigMap containing a rego rule package for Trino has to be applied and referenced in the TrinoCluster resource.
The following example is an all-access Rego rule for testing with the user `admin`. Do not use it in production!
The rego rules below are written using Rego V1 to be compatible with the OPA v1.0.0 release. 

NOTE: Due to changes in the Trino OPA authorizer, rego rules differ between version 414, 428 and newer versions.

=== Rego for Trino version 414

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/opa-bundle-trino-cm-414.yaml[]
----

=== Rego for Trino version 428

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/opa-bundle-trino-cm-428.yaml[]
----

=== Rego for Trino version 439

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/opa-bundle-trino-cm-439.yaml[]
----

Reference the package in the Trino cluster:

[source,yaml]
----
...
spec:
  clusterConfig:
    authorization:
      opa:
        configMapName: opa  # <1>
        package: trino      # <2>
...
----

<1> The name of the OpaCluster
<2> The name of the package defined in the rego rule ConfigMap

== Define a secure cluster

For secure connections the following steps must be taken:

1. Enable authentication
2. Enable TLS between the clients and coordinator
3. Enable internal TLS for communication between coordinators and workers

=== Via authentication

If authentication is enabled, https://trino.io/docs/current/security/tls.html[TLS] for the coordinator as well as a shared secret for https://trino.io/docs/current/security/internal-communication.html[internal communications] (this is base64 and not encrypted) must be configured.

Securing the Trino cluster will disable all HTTP ports and disable the web interface on the HTTP port as well. In the definition below the authentication is directed to use the `trino-users` secret and TLS communication will use a certificate signed by the Secret Operator (indicated by `autoTls`).

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-secure-tls.yaml[]
----

<1> The name of (and reference to) the `SecretClass`
<2> The name of (and reference to) the `Secret`
<3> The `AuthenticationClass` for file based user control
<4> The `Secret` containing user and password combinations in plaintext
<5> `TrinoCatalog` reference
<6> TLS mechanism

The CLI now requires that a path to the keystore and a password be provided:

[source]
----
./trino.jar --debug --server https://172.18.0.3:31748
--user=admin --keystore-path=<path-to-keystore.p12> --keystore-password=<password>
----

=== Via TLS only

This will disable the HTTP port and UI access and encrypt client-server communications.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-secure-tls-only.yaml[]
----

<1> The name of (and reference to) the `SecretClass`
<2> `TrinoCatalog` reference
<3> TLS mechanism

CLI callout:

[source]
----
./trino.jar --debug --server https://172.18.0.3:31748 --keystore-path=<path-to-keystore.p12> --keystore-password=<password>
----

=== Via internal TLS

Internal TLS is for encrypted and authenticated communications between coordinators and workers. Since this applies to all the data send and processed between the processes, this may reduce the performance significantly.

[source,yaml]
----
include::example$usage-guide/trino-secure-internal-tls.yaml[]
----

<1> The name of (and reference to) the `SecretClass`
<2> The name of (and reference to) the `Secret`
<3> The `AuthenticationClass` for file based user control
<4> The `Secret` containing user and password combinations in plaintext
<5> TLS mechanism

Since Trino has internal and external communications running over a single port, this will enable the HTTPS port but not expose it. Cluster access is only possible via HTTP.

[source]
----
./trino.jar --debug --server http://172.18.0.3:31748 --user=admin
