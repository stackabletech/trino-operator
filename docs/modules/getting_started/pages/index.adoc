= Getting started

This guide will get you started with Trino using the Stackable Operator. It will guide you through the installation of the operator and its dependencies and setting up your first Trino cluster.

== Prerequisites

You will need:

* a Kubernetes cluster
* kubectl
* optional: Helm
* optional: Trino CLI tool and curl (for testing)

Resource sizing depends on cluster type(s), usage and scope, but as a starting point we recommend a minimum of the following resources for this operator:

* 0.2 cores (e.g. i5 or similar)
* 256MB RAM
